# Food-Donation-Website
The Food Donation Website is a community-driven platform designed to bridge the gap between food donors (individuals, restaurants, grocery stores) and NGOs or individuals in need. The primary objective is to reduce food waste and ensure surplus food reaches the underprivileged in a timely and efficient manner.
